Prelim offset_experiment
==============
, because less cognitive contamination, with different eccentricities so can have an exactly-comparable condition at fixation.
- Downside of 2 targets is that when concentric you can occasionally group them. That will make concentric look better than it should.
- Critical issue is speed limit of smaller-radius one when not concentric. Smaller one is always ringToQuery=0. Speed limit for me is lower by about 0.4rps.
