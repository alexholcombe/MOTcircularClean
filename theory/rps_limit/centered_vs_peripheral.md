Experiment: Concentric vs. peripheral
==============

Is the speed limit the same in the periphery, when not rotating about fixation?
- See [theory](theory.md) for uncrowded stimulus choice and prediction
- Eyetracked, thanks to Chris, him and L
- Used 2 targets at first but not a good idea

- We know the speed limit can't be a blur-limited limit because temporal blurring length is proportional to linear speed, not rps. So in periphery, looks really blurred yet speed limit doesn't go down much. (Ultimately temporal blurring predicts a tf limit but already shown that doesn't hit until 7 Hz, far faster than 2 rps).
- Could do it with 1 target, but then have the eye movements problem and worse blurring problem at 120 Hz. Somewhat mitigated by having both orbits present but only one with a target.
- Have to just use single ring? Although there will always be a confound between crossing hemifields and not. Speed limit could conceivably even have been one of crossing hemifields. Yes, so I'm testing that hypothesis.

3 conditions (tested >= 3 Ss)
- One trajectory, centered.  r=6
- One trajectory, a bit off center. e=5
- One trajectory, way off center. e=10 or 11
- Crossed with a second factor which puts the periphery one in each quadrant, yielding 12 conditions. Actually that's too many conditions, so did it only with left and right, not up and down also.

So the centered one won't happen very often because the two others each have two versions, making a total of 5 conditions.

Seem to need more cuingTime because gotta get oneself stably fixating even when not center

### Results
- Fajou too fast

When results finished, point been made that neurons-per-unit time theory is false.

### Figures
[Generate vector images that show the trajectories tested. While we're at it, also circle versus diamond.](stimSchematics.Rmd)


### To-do

- Still need to figure out screwed-up resolution thing on Alex's computer (new problem). SwitchResX resolutions not showing up, or after selection in SwitchResX, resolution picked up by PsychoPy seems different than what it is.
- Need a 4th participant
