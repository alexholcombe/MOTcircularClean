Mental rotation
==============

Because what else could explain a rotational speed limit?

# Mental rotation

- Cooper et al. (1976). Figure 2 RT elevation is 320 ms for 180 deg or 640 ms for 360 deg or 1.6 rps. Similar in Figure 3.
- Cooper (1975) Fig 2. Slope = 2.16 ms/deg.  1.29 rps.
- Provost et al. (2013). Matching task, not explicit mental rotation
  - E1 few stimuli, repeated 500ms/180deg = 1rps
  - E2 many stimuli 1.1s/180deg = 2.2s/1rev = 0.45 rps
