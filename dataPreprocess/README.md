==============

loadAnonymiseSaveData.R is used to match up Psychopy datafiles with EDF files, and combine multiple sessions together.

Functions in the [eyetracking](eyetracking) sub-folder are used for deciding whether a trial should be excluded.

That folder also has stuff for having a look at the EDF files and doing eyetracking analysis development, and it has its own eyetrackingDebugAndExplore.Rproj file.

The [analysis](../analysis) directory with its R project is used to analyze the data.
