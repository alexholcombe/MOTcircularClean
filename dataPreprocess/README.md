==============

The [eyetracking](eyetracking) sub-folder is for having a look at the EDF files and doing eyetracking analysis development, and it has its own eyetrackingDebugAndExplore.Rproj file.

Eventually loadAnonymiseSaveData.R is used to match up Psychopy datafiles with EDF files, and possibly combine multiple sessions together. Then the [analysis](../analysis) directory with its R project is used to analyze the data.
