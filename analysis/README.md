Analysis of Multiple object tracking data
==============

With R,
doAllAnalyses.R analyses all the data, after it's been anonymised by dataPreprocess

This uses some functions copied from the modelfree package.

## Fitting a psychophysical function with logistic regression and custom link function

### Old method from <2014


I think with brglm, it doesn't support custom link function, so I scale the y's from guessing->(1-lapseRate) to 0 to 1. But then some of the data is actually below guessing and above 1-lapseRate, and because in logistic regression the y's can't be greater than 1 or below 0, I truncate those, which is not good. So need to switch to non-brglm so can use custom link function, and need to then use logit_link_private.

On line 35 of analyzeMakeReadyForPlot, line 35 set initialMethod to "glmCustomlink" 

## Newer method?

But with brglm2, brglmFit() now takes custom link functions. https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/brglm2/news/news.html

Turning any link function into a custom link function with upper bound, https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/617389/custom-link-function-needed-for-generalised-linear-model-in-r

A problem is that it's not constrained binomial regression, but we want to constrain it such that at speed = 0, %correct is 1-lapseRate. Unfortunately brglm doesn't provide constrained fit, not even in brglm2.
I suppose if we took the logarithm of the speed before doing the fit, it would do that, because log(0) = -infinity
