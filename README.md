Multiple object tracking experiment
==============
This program is super-complicated, legacy of many different papers using tracking. I don't recommend you use it without my guidance. My other repositories, such as attentional-blink, are more user-friendly.

In the long term, want to set up exchange of objects among rings. Necessary to conduct an identity-tracking experiment. Can also push harder on speed limit that way.

### Issues
-Improve anonymisation algorithm


## Eyetracking Nov 2023

Try drift correction and try without it

## Eyetracking


To the self-test of eyetrackingCode/EyeLinkCoreGraphicsPsychoPyHolcombeLab.py, I've tried to add a trial. Don't think that version is tested yet.
